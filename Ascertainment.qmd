# Ascertainment

## Example

Burton et al (2000) provide the following example:

They simulated a population containing 4,800 sibships of size 3, with a total of 14,400 children, and 864 affected children. In this population, the prevalence of the disease is 864/14400, which equals 0.06:

```{r}
864/14400
```

In their simulation, they then sampled every family that contained one or more affected child, and ended up with this set of 813 families:

N Aff Children | N Sibships 
------------- | ------------- 
1 | 763 
2 | 49 
3 | 1

**Question 1**: What is the prevalence in this sample of 813 families if we compute it without employing any ascertainment correction?

```{webr-r}
# Edit/add R code here
         
```

## Answer 1

The prevalence without any ascertainment correction is 864/(3\*813) = 0.3542.

```{r}
864/(3*813)
```

**Question 2**: What is the prevalence estimate after correcting for ascertainment?

```{webr-r}
# Edit/add R code here
        
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Answer 2

Here we use the formula

p = (R - J)/(T - J)

where

-   R = the total number of affected siblings
-   T = the total number of siblings
-   J = the number of siblings with only one proband

In this case,

-   R = 864
-   T = 3 \* 813 = 2439
-   J = 763

So p = (R - J)/(T - J) = (864 - 763)/(2439 - 763) = 0.0603

```{r}
R = 864
T = 3 * 813 
J = 763
(R - J)/(T - J)
```
